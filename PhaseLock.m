% Generating phase-locked spike sequences (ver 1.0)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input 
%  M: number of input fibers 
%  N: time steps 
%  F: frequency [Hz]
%  R: vector strength (0<=R<=0.96 for a reliable calculation)
%  L: mean rate [spikes/sec] 
%  P: initial phase [rad]
%  DT: time step size [ms] 
% 
% Output: 
%  A: spike vector (M*N matrix)
%  K: concentration parameter
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Tech notes
%  This script generates phase-locked spike sequences using the 
%  Poissonian spike generation algorithm and the von Mises distribution. 
%  For detailed relations between the von Mises distribution and resulting 
%  vector strength, see Ashida et al. (2013) Front Comput Neurosci 7:151
